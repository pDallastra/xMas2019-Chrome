                    <p>It was hard to find pictures of Matt. But the reason I chose this one is because that's how I see him, always surround of good people and so happy!</p>

                    <p>He also received his brother's friend as family. He tried to help us with our kids and make them have fun.</p>

                    <p>It is hard to understand sometimes why life is so hard. But behind every situation there is something God wants us to learn. I know he gives the hardest tasks and 
                    experiences to those who is able to handle it, and the person who Matt is shows that he has always done his best to overcome hard situations. Thanks for being an example!</p>
