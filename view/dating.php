                    <p>Our first time going to a Temple. After few months talking a friend asked: "Why don't you guys start dating?" - We kissed for the first time that night and oficially dating on the next day.</p>

                    <p>First picture of us alone. We were dating for a couple weeks and didn't know that her parents would be on our way to continue dating.</p>

                    <p>Her family didn't approved our relationship, but we loved each other so much already. The picture of the Temple saying: "This is Our Goal" didn't look like to be real at the time.</p>
