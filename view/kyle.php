                    <p>Kyle left his home/family to come to my country and serve people there. And I could see him doing his best during his time over there.</p>

                    <p>I wasn't supposed to be his companion for a couple of months, but Heavenly Father did a way to put me with him for 3 months, and that changed my life.</p>

                    <p>I will never forget him not only for taking care of myself when I had to pull out my wisdom teeth, but most important, because of the people we served together in Curitiba.</p>

                    <p>I already have a page for his family, but here I would like to mention that after meeting them, I realized where all the kindness and unselfishness came from.</p>

                    <p>I remember him telling me about his desire of graduate from a specific university, but feeling that he had something more important to do in another one.</p>

                    <p>Not only he got into a great program and academic success, but he also found a great person called Monika! Since we met her, she has treated us not only as her husband's friends
                    but as her family as well!</p>
