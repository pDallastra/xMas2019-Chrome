                    <p>I will never forget how Brady received us and treated us so well. He cooked for us and was so patient with our pretty bad English. 
                    During a transitioning time he accepted us as family to go through that without problems.</p>

                    <p>She adopted us as her siblings since first time. Treated us so well and took care of our kids as her kids. Always trying to motive us making sure
                    that we know how much we have done so far and how much we are able to do. We can feel her love for us.</p>

                    <p>They got married on one of the most pure ways possible. And then, they have been building their family with so much love. They worked so hard on
                    themselves and because of that they are building a successful life/family. Such a great example to us.</p>

                    <p>They got some tickets for a special event in Salt Lake City. We only could enjoy the event online, and even the tickets getting sold out in minutes
                    they saved two of them so my wife and I could come with them and enjoy the event. What a wonderful time!</p>

                    <p>I know they are disciples of Christ! Because they love and help others so much as He did, and because of that they deserve all the success they have achieved
                    and will achieve in the future.</p>

                    <p>We love you so much, and if we can't do for you as much as you have done for us, we will make sure to do it for others because the phrase "Thank You" is just not enough
                    to express what we feel.</p>
